if statement_to_be_evaluated == true
  # do something awesome...
end

if 1 < 2
  puts "Hot diggity, 1 is less than 2!"
end
#=> Hot diggity, 1 is less than 2!


#A cleaner way to write it as below:
puts "Hot diggity damn, 1 is less than 2" if 1 < 2

#How to use an if,else, and elsif statement:

if attack_by_land == true
  puts "release the goat"
elsif attack_by_sea == true
  puts "release the shark"
else
  puts "release Kevin the octopus"
end

#Another condition to look out for is the "<=>" 
(spaceship operator) returns the following:

-1 if the value on the left is less than the value on the right;
0 if the value on the left is equal to the value on the right; and
1 if the value on the left is greater than the value on the right.


#Unless statements work the opposite of if.Only works if the function is deemed false.

age = 18
puts "Welcome to a life of debt." unless age < 17

unless age < 17
  puts "Down with that sort of thing."
else
  puts "Careful now!"
