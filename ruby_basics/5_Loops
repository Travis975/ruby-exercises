#Loops are used to do a repetitive tasks. They infinitly loop until specified by a break with a condition.

i = 0
loop do
  puts "i is #{i}"
  i += 1
  break if i == 10
end

#While loops are similar but there condition is stated from the start.

i = 0
while i < 10 do
 puts "i is #{i}"
 i += 1
end

#Another way to use a loop is to pose a question till the desired answer is met. 

while gets.chomp != "yes" do
  puts "Will you go to prom with me?"
end

#An until loop is the opposite of a while loop. A while loop works when the condition is true but a until loop works when the condition is false.

i = 0
until i >= 10 do
 puts "i is #{i}"
 i += 1
end

until gets.chomp == "yes" do
  puts "Will you go to prom with me?"
end

#When you know how many time you want to iterate through some code, you can use the for loop.

for i in 0..5
  puts "#{i} zombies incoming!"
end

#A similar loop is the times loop.

5.times do
  puts "Hello, world!"
end

5.times do |number|
  puts "Alternative fact number #{number}"
end


#The last two kinds of loops are the upto and downto loop.Used when you want to start and stop at a specific point. 

5.upto(10) {|num| print "#{num} " }     #=> 5 6 7 8 9 10

10.downto(5) {|num| print "#{num} " }   #=> 10 9 8 7 6 5
